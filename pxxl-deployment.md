# Pxxl Deployment Notes — Entry (thirdbase1/Entry)

Last updated: 2026-07-24 (corrected — earlier version of this file had the wrong account)

## THE correct account and project

- Account: **miraclethirdbase1@gmail.com**
- Project: **entry** — id `proj_ibab5ldta4l63qoentq7`
- Domain: **entry.pxxl.pro**
- This is a working, healthy, live deployment with multiple successful
  "deployed/completed" runs. Confirmed live 2026-07-24: `GET /` -> 200,
  `GET /api/health` -> `{"ok":true,"db":"connected"}`.
- All required env vars are already pushed to this project (DATABASE_URL,
  BETTER_AUTH_SECRET, BYOK_ENCRYPTION_KEY, CREDENTIAL_VAULT_KEY, GitHub
  OAuth creds, etc.) — check with `pxxl env list proj_ibab5ldta4l63qoentq7`
  before assuming something's missing.

To use this account in the sandbox, always run explicitly:
```bash
export PXXL_API_KEY="pxxl_6yvxGOg_fE0y2UQjtyty21sB_5BQmwy6pV88AAvRhbc"
unset PXXL_TOKEN
pxxl whoami   # should print miraclethirdbase1@gmail.com — confirm before anything else
```

## Do NOT use these — they are wrong accounts / dead ends

- The sandbox's default `$PXXL_TOKEN` / `$PXXL_API_KEY` env vars (present
  without you setting anything) resolve to **vwhehj@gmail.com**. That
  account also has a project confusingly also named `entry`
  (`proj_jja54nhxtknvzc31alcx`) but it has ONLY failed deployments — every
  attempt fails at Pxxl's "proxy route promotion" step even though the app
  starts and passes health check. Do not confuse this with the real
  project just because the name matches.
- The CLI's stored login session (`~/.config/pxxl/config.json`) resolves
  to **alfredjames0852@gmail.com** — an unrelated account with stray test
  projects (`oneshotsx-entry`, `entry-test-5/10/15`) created by mistake
  while chasing the wrong account on 2026-07-24. Ignore/leave these alone.
- **Always run `pxxl whoami` first** before any Pxxl command if there's
  any doubt which account/key is active — this single mistake (using the
  wrong account) wasted an entire session of retries on 2026-07-24.

## Gotchas discovered along the way (still valid, keep in mind for future deploys)

1. **`.pxxlignore` gets silently reset to Pxxl's hardcoded default after
   EVERY deploy** (`writeDefaultPxxlFiles` runs post-deploy and overwrites
   any custom ignore rules). Rewrite your custom `.pxxlignore` immediately
   before every single `pxxl deploy` call.
2. **~16MB hard cap on the CLI upload endpoint** — exceeding it returns a
   raw/unhelpful `502`. Binary-search the zip size if you hit a mystery 502.
3. **500-file cap** on the upload archive, separate from the byte-size cap.
   This is a monorepo (`apps/web` + `apps/agent` + `packages`); `apps/agent`
   alone is ~700 files if included wholesale.
4. **`apps/web` genuinely imports from `apps/agent`** via the `@entry/agent`
   workspace package — check `apps/agent/package.json`'s `exports` map
   before excluding anything. Only `agent/lib/**` (~58 files) is actually
   exported/used by `apps/web`. Safe to exclude: `apps/agent/.agents/**`,
   `apps/agent/agent/skills/**`, `apps/agent/agent/{tools,channels,hooks,
   sandbox,instructions}/**`, `apps/agent/evals/**`.
5. **A blanket `patches/` ignore rule can wipe out a required local
   dependency tarball** inside `apps/web/patches` needed by `patch-package`
   at `postinstall` — don't exclude `patches` wholesale.
6. **Large binary assets in `apps/web/public`** (e.g. a 26MB onboarding
   video) blow past size/file caps fast — host large media externally
   (e.g. Base44 public file storage) instead of bundling in the repo.
7. **Domains are globally unique across ALL Pxxl accounts**, not just
   per-account — a "domain already in use" error can mean a different
   account owns it, not necessarily you.
8. **The CLI's buildpack doesn't stream `npm run build`'s real output**
   into `pxxl logs` — you'll only see `npm install`/`postinstall` logs,
   then `[pxxl] build -> true` with nothing in between. This does NOT mean
   the build didn't run; verify by testing the live URL, not by looking
   for missing build logs.
9. Deploys to project `entry` (proj_ibab5ldta4l63qoentq7) happen via
   `pxxl deploy` CLI zip upload from a local working directory — this is
   independent of git. The "commit" shown in `pxxl deployments get` is a
   local snapshot label, not necessarily a real GitHub SHA. Still push to
   GitHub (thirdbase1/Entry, main) for history/durability and because
   Render deploys from git — just know the Pxxl deploy step itself doesn't
   require or trigger from a git push.

## Standard deploy procedure

```bash
# 1. Confirm the right account
export PXXL_API_KEY="pxxl_6yvxGOg_fE0y2UQjtyty21sB_5BQmwy6pV88AAvRhbc"
unset PXXL_TOKEN
pxxl whoami   # must say miraclethirdbase1@gmail.com

# 2. Work from a fresh clone/pull of thirdbase1/Entry
git pull origin main   # or fresh clone

# 3. Rewrite .pxxlignore fresh — it resets after every deploy, do this
#    immediately before every single deploy call, no exceptions
cat > .pxxlignore << 'EOF'

## Why the successful deploys worked (and the broken ones didn't) — root cause

All Pxxl deploys go through the same last step: after the container passes
its own health check, Pxxl "Promotes the proxy route" — this has a tight
~15-20s window. On the 5 successful `entry` deploys, this step consistently
finished in ~13-14s. On every failed attempt (both the 2 failures on this
same project, and all attempts on the wrong `vwhehj@gmail.com` project),
it missed that window and timed out. Root cause: the successful deploys
start the app via Next.js **standalone output mode**
(`node apps/web/.next/standalone/apps/web/server.js`), which boots far
faster than `next start` (skips full node_modules/workspace resolution).
The failed attempts used `next start` directly, which is slow enough to
usually blow past Pxxl's promotion timeout.

**Lesson: always start from standalone output on Pxxl, never `next start`.**
`next.config` already has `output: 'standalone'` set repo-wide (used by
Render too), so this just means using the right startCommand:

```
buildCommand = "SKIP_PRODUCTION_MIGRATE_GUARD=1 npm run build && mkdir -p apps/web/.next/standalone/apps/web/.next && cp -r apps/web/.next/static apps/web/.next/standalone/apps/web/.next/static && cp -r apps/web/public apps/web/.next/standalone/apps/web/public"
startCommand = "node apps/web/.next/standalone/apps/web/server.js"
```

`SKIP_PRODUCTION_MIGRATE_GUARD=1` skips `prisma migrate deploy` at build
time — Render already owns migrations against the same shared Neon DB, so
this avoids a double-migrate race between the two hosts. If a new Prisma
migration folder is ever added, apply it manually once via
`POST /api/admin/db/migrate` after that specific deploy.

Even with the standalone server, the promotion step is NOT 100%
deterministic (2 of 7 deploys on the correct project still failed) — it's
inherently a bit flaky on Pxxl's side. If a deploy fails at "Proxy route
promotion delayed", just retry `pxxl deploy` again as-is; it's a transient
race, not a config problem, as long as startCommand uses the standalone
server.
